# CoinCanvas

## Author: James Brooks

## Description

Coin Canvas is a simple and easy to use website that allows users to sign in and view a chart representing the price history of a given Stock or Crypto Currency that remembers the user's desired charts so long as they were signed in when they viewed them.

It is designed to be lightweight and with as few extraneous additions as possible as well as providing the data in an easy to understand format.

The project is primarily a remake and expansion upon a project I previously worked on with a group during my education called Chartify, the link to the GitHub Repo of the original project can be found here: [Link](https://github.com/open-bracket-space-close-bracket/chartify)
